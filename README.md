HTML

HTML is the standard markup language for Web pages. It is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. 
"Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or between websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.
HTML uses "markup" to annotate text, images, and other content for display in a Web browser. HTML markup includes special "elements" such as <head>, <title>, <body>, <header>, <footer>, <article>, <section>, <p>, <div>, <span>, <img>, <aside>, <audio>, <canvas>, <datalist>, <details>, <embed>, <nav>, <output>, <progress>, <video>, <ul>, <ol>, <li> and many others.
An HTML element is set off from other text in a document by "tags", which consist of the element name surrounded by "<" and ">". The name of an element inside a tag is case insensitive. That is, it can be written in uppercase, lowercase, or a mixture. For example, the <title> tag can be written as <Title>, <TITLE>, or in any other way. However, the convention and recommended practice is to write tags in lowercase.
Elements in HTML have attributes; these are additional values that configure the elements or adjust their behavior in various ways to meet the criteria the users want.
In HTML, link types indicate the relationship between two documents, in which one links to the other using an <a>, <area>, <form>, or <link> element.


CSS


Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML.
Like HTML, CSS is not a programming language. It's not a markup language either. CSS is a style sheet language. CSS is what you use to selectively style HTML elements.
The whole structure of a css is called a ruleset.
selector : This is the HTML element name at the start of the ruleset. It defines the element(s) to be styled (in this example, <p> elements). To style a different element, change the selector.
Declaration: This is a single rule like color: red;. It specifies which of the element's properties you want to style.
Properties: These are ways in which you can style an HTML element. (In this example, color is a property of the <p> elements.) In CSS, you choose which properties you want to affect in the rule.
Property value: To the right of the property—after the colon—there is the property value. This chooses one out of many possible appearances for a given property. (For example, there are many color values in addition to red.)
Note the other important parts of the syntax:

  Apart from the selector, each ruleset must be wrapped in curly braces. ({})
  Within each declaration, you must use a colon (:) to separate the property from its value or values.
  Within each ruleset, you must use a semicolon (;) to separate each declaration from the next one.
  
  
  
JavaScript


JavaScript is a programming language that allows you to implement complex things on web pages.
Javascript is used by programmers across the world to create dynamic and interactive web content like applications and browsers. 
The core client-side JavaScript language consists of some common programming features that allow you to do things like:
  Store useful values inside variables. In the above example for instance, we ask for a new name to be entered then     store that name in a variable called name.
  Operations on pieces of text (known as "strings" in programming). In the above example we take the string "Player     1: " and join it to the name variable to create the complete text label, e.g. "Player 1: Chris".
  Running code in response to certain events occurring on a web page. We used a click event in our example above to     detect when the label is clicked and then run the code that updates the text label.
In JavaScript, most things are objects, from core JavaScript features like arrays to the browser APIs built on top of JavaScript. You can even create your own objects to encapsulate related functions and variables into efficient packages and act as handy data containers.


python

Python is a popular programming language. It is used for:
  web development (server-side),
  software development,
  mathematics,
  system scripting.
Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.
Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.
Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.
Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.

Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.

Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.
Python has no command for declaring a variable.

A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
